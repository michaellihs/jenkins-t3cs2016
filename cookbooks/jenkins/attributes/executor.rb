  # This is the number of seconds to wait for Jenkins to become "ready" after a
  # start, restart, or reload. Since the Jenkins service returns immediately
  # and the actual Java process is started in the background, we block the Chef
  # Client run until the service endpoint(s) are _actually_ ready to accept
  # requests.

  # If you need to pass through a proxy to communicate between your masters and
  # slaves, you will need to set this node attribute. It should be  set in the

  # Please see the +Proxies+ section of the README for more information.
